# Selenium-Testing-Project
Requirements:
1. Use Maven as your project and add dependency in your pom.xml.
2. Take screenshots before and after every step is successfully executed and save them in a folder with the scenario name.
3. After a scenario is executed next scenario is run automatically without a manual intervention.
4. You can use Java or Python as a programming language. 
5. Add correct Assertions wherever required.
6. Create a HTML report of the scenarios with the following columns:
•	Test scenario name
•	Actual
•	Expected
•	Pass/Fail
Note: 
1)	The HTML report is one way of generating a report, if you can think of something else you can implement it.
2)	Regarding the two-factor authentication. YOU CAN hit the enter key once manually during your session for the purpose of the two-factor authentication, that will be OK. Other than that, no other manual intervention will be acceptable.
